## Mapping


Mapping feels so easy these days. Leaflet-draw is awesome for drawing coordinates

## Quick 'n' dirty: jQuery

## Brunch build

Since this is a learning experience, I figured I would try to wrap my head around a js build tool. Phoenix uses Brunch by default, so that's where I ended up.
If I had to do it over, I might have tried webpack, since that seems to be the leader these days.

- Loads modules
- Need to figure out how to require in js
- Are all scripts included in every pageload?
- Manual step to copy leaflet-draw icons/images to web/static/assets
